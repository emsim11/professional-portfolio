# Professional Portfolio
Columbia Module 2 Challenge: Advanced CSS Challenge

## Description
For this project, I have been tasked with creating a web application from scratch to build a portfolio page that showcases my skills and talents. This portfolio will allow employers looking to fill a part-time or full-time position to view my skills, talents, and qualifications. An effective portfolio will highlight my strongest work as well as the thought processes behind it. It will also have several deployed web applications and projects, as this is a minimum requirement to receive an initial interview at many companies. This Challenge will set me up for future success by applying the core skills I have learned: flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables.
